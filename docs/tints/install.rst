Installing a tint
#################
There is no central tint library yet, but you can install tints from any GIT repository your hex can reach. For example, we host most of our tints from bitbucket.org, but you can do the same from GitHub.

Installing a tint is as simple as going to your management console, click through to the library and press the + sign on the left of the screen. Once you have done so, you will be able to enter the url to your git repository. Once you submit the form, the sidebar will go away and you will see a tile with your tint. Press the install button on the lower part of the tile and your tint will be installed.

Technology tints are currently the only tints available, but this will change soon.
