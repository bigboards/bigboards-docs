The BigBoards micro-clusters are purpose-build hardware to fulfill the requirements for anyone interested in learning and working with data at scale.

As such your BigBoards device is a true physical big data cluster. It actually is a micro-datacenter on its own, consisting of a number identical nodes. 

The BigBoards devices are built around the popular [Intel NUC platform](http://www.intel.com/nuc). 

## Single node

A single node in your micro-cluster is a complete computer, incl. cpu, memory and storage. It is up to the apps that you install on top of these nodes, to combine all these separate resources into a cluster and make all the nodes act as 1 system.

You can choose between 2 CPU configurations for the nodes; all the other parts are mostly standardized. 

 - **CPU**: i3 or i5
 - **Memory**: 16Gb
 - **OS disk**: 30Gb SSD
 - **Data disk**: 1Tb HDD 2.5" 7200rpm

All nodes in our micro-clusters are interconnected via a **1GB ethernet** network. 

## Models
While the name of the models refers to the shape of the device, it is also an indication to the amount
of nodes inside them:

 - **The Cube** holds 3 nodes
 - **The Hex** contains 6 nodes

A single micro-cluster has 2 external ethernet ports that you can use to plug your device in your LAN, attach it directly to your personal computer or daisy chain multiple devices together.

### The Cube

The cube is the newest addition to the bigboards device family. It's a micro-cluster holding 3 nodes. It is ideally suited to learn and experiment with data technologies like Spark and ElasticSearch.

### The Hex

The hex is the full-fledged, most complete version of our micro-clusters to date. It holds 6 nodes, allowing
you to experiment with more complex setups.
