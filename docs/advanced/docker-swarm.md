# Docker Swarm
Current versions of the [Docker Engine] include swarm mode for natively 
managing a cluster of Docker Engines, called a swarm. Use the Docker CLI 
to create a swarm, deploy application services to a swarm, and manage swarm 
behavior.

[Docker Cloud] provides a hosted 
[registry service](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/repos/) with 
[build](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/automated-build/) and 
[testing](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/builds/automated-testing/) facilities 
for Dockerized application images; tools to help you set up and [manage host 
infrastructure](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/infrastructure/); and 
[application lifecycle features](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/apps/) to 
automate deploying (and redeploying) services created from images.

This tutorial outlines how to turn your BigBoards device in a 
[Docker Swarm] and manage it from anywhere in the world from your local 
[Docker Engine] via [Docker Cloud].

## Prerequisites
To complete the tutorial, there are some prerequisites:

1. Do a [factory reset](../hardware/factory-reset.md) of your device.
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) on all nodes 
    1. `bb run 'apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get update'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y upgrade'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y autoremove'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y install linux-image-extra-$(uname -r) linux-image-extra-virtual'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common'`
    1. `bb run 'curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -'`
    1. `bb run 'add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y update'`
    1. `bb run 'apt-get -y install docker-ce'`
    1. `bb run 'docker run hello-world'`
    
## Build a swarm
The next step is to turn your BigBoards device in a [Docker Swarm]. 

How to do this is explained in Docker's [Swarm tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/create-swarm/), 
but here is the rundown:

1. Log in to your device's 1st node, the manager node
1. Initialize the swarm manager
    1. Note the IP address of the manager node; you can use the internal IP
    1. `docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>`
    1. Copy the command to join the swarm as it is printed by the init command
1. Join the other nodes to the swarm
    1. `ansible host-workers --sudo -m shell -a '<COMMAND-TO-JOIN>'`
1. Check the status of the swarm
    1. `docker info` gives you an overview of the swarm
    1. `docker node ls` lists all nodes in the swarm, e.g. 
    
```
ID                            HOSTNAME            STATUS              AVAILABILITY        MANAGER STATUS
pjtfg2sxm914w616bufmh9tqq *   jill-n1             Ready               Active              Leader
jgqr12mnpxf91lk1fj4eihudf     jill-n2             Ready               Active
c8tqqhjhrr0ng4bwbx8joxf3o     jill-n3             Ready               Active
``` 

## Link to Docker Cloud
From the [Docker Cloud], you can manage your [Docker Swarm] cluster. We first 
need to link your swarm to the cloud. 

1. Create an account on [Docker Cloud] and log in.
1. Link your swarm
    1. From the top menu, go to *Swarms (Beta)*
    1. Click *Bring your own swarm*
    1. Run the commands presented to you and name your swarm
    1. Make sure your router/firewall forwards port 2376 to your masternode
1. On your personal computer, connect to your swarm through Docker Cloud 
    1. Follow the instruction in the tutorial [Connect to swarm through Docker Cloud](https://docs.docker.com/docker-cloud/cloud-swarm/connect-to-swarm/)
    1. Listing the nodes `docker node ls` should give the same result as above
1. Finally, test your swarm by [Deploying a service to the swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/deploy-service/)

## Wrap up
So, that's it! In this tutorial you learned:

1. How to turn your BigBards device into a [Docker Swarm] cluster
1. How to link your BigBoards swarm to [Docker Cloud]

With this a setup, you have a 3 or 6 node swarm, which you can 
completely manage from the [Docker Engine] running on your Personal Computer.

## Unswarm
To undo the swarming of you BigBoards device, follow these steps:

1. Remove all running services
    1. List running services `docker service ls`
    1. Remove running services `docker service rm <SERVICE>` 
1. Disconnect your local [Docker Engine] from your swarm
    1. `unset DOCKER_HOST`
1. Remove your swarm from [Docker Cloud]
    1. Go to [Docker Cloud]
    1. Log in
    1. Go to *Swarms (Beta)*
    1. Find the target swarm in the list
    1. Use the â ‡ drop down menu 
    1. *Unregister* the swarm
1. Log in to the devices 1st node
1. End running services
    1. `docker service ls`
    1. `docker service rm 'dockercloud-server-proxy'`
1. Unswarm the nodes of your BigBoards device
    1. List the nodes in the swarm `docker node ls`
    1. Remove the workers `ansible host-workers --sudo -m shell -a 'docker swarm leave'`
    1. Verify workers have left `docker node ls` should indicate status `Down`
    1. Have the master node leave the swarm `docker swarm leave -f` which will also erase all cluster state!
