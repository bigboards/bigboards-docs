Software

Contrary to what many people expect when they first look at BigBoards, it is not all about hardware.

Console
=======================================================================================================================
The console provides an easy way to work with your Hex. It allows you to monitor the usage of the Hex' resources, but that's not all. It also allows you to perform operations like updating the software running on the Hex or even installing tints. Consider it to be the gateway to your Hex.

You can find more details about the console in its own documentation section.

Tint
=======================================================================================================================
One of the goals of BigBoards is to get you up and running as fast as possible. To fulfill this promise we came up with a tint. A tint is something you can put onto your Hex, software wise. That might sound quite vague, but let me make it more concrete by classifying tints in 3 different categories:

#. Technology Tints
#. Data Tints
#. Educational Tints

Each of these tint categories provide a different facility to the Hex. Technology tints for example bring distributed software stacks to the Hex while a data tint will provide that data for you to work on. Educational tints are something special since they provide the tutorials, howto's, documentation and other resources you need to learn about technologies. By combining all of these we can come up with a total solution for building scalable software solutions.
