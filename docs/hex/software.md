# Software

Contrary to what many people expect when they first look at BigBoards, it is not all about hardware.

## Management Console

The **management console** (MMC) provides an easy way to work with your Hex. 

* It allows you to **monitor** the usage of the Hex' resources, . 
* but also allows you to perform **operations** like 
	* **updating the software** running on the Hex or 
	* even **installing tints**. 

Consider the MMC to be the gateway to your Hex.

You can find more details about the console in its own documentation section.

## Tint

One of the goals of BigBoards is to get you up and running with Big Data development as fast as possible. That's why we came up with the concept of **Tints**. A **Tint** is software package that you can deploy onto your Hex. That might sound quite vague, but lets make tints more specific. There are **3 different categories** of Tints, each of which bring a different functionality to the Hex

1. **Technology** Tints bring distributed software stacks to the Hex,
1. while **Data** Tints will provide data for you to work with,
1. whereas **Educational** Tints are a bit special since they provide the tutorials, how-to's, documentation and other resources you need to learn about the technologies.

By combining all of these Tints we can come up with a total solution for building scalable software.
