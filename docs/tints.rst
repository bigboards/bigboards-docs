Tints
#######################################################################################################################
When you are learning you will probably come across different technology stacks and architectures, each with their own peculiarities. In a lot of the cases you aren't even interested in going through the process of installing and configuring all the different parts that make up the architecture. The same goes for data, where you don't want to search and figure out all of these formats. The only thing you actually want is start learning, developing or exploring. In other words, you want to get the job done for you.

This is what tints are all about. We called them to live to make it easier for you to get started with the things you **want** to do, skipping the things you **have** to do.

There are 3 categories of tints, each of them serving a different purpose but all with the same goal; making your life easier.

Technology Tints
=======================================================================================================================
Technology tints bring your favorite stack to the Hex. It allows you to get started with your technology stack as fast as possible. We currently have two tech-tints available; one for Hadoop 2.2.0 and one for ElasticSearch, but expect a lot more of them in the near future.

If you have a suggestion for a tint, you may always send us your ideas. Or you can always create one yourself.

Data Tints
=======================================================================================================================
We wrapped some of the publicly available datasets in what we call a data tint. They share the ease of use of technology tints but instead of bringing a stack to the Hex, they will bring the data you can use within your stack.

Educational Tints
=======================================================================================================================
We want to make it as easy as possible to learn about new technologies, which is why we introduced educational tints. This type of tints bring documentation and tutorials to your Hex.
