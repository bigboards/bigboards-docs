You might have seen terms like 'Hex' or 'Tint' on our website or even in the documentation you are reading right now. Allow us to place them into context for you.

Hex
=======================================================================================================================
A hex points actually to the hardware device we are offering as a part of BigBoards. Actually calling it a device does not do it justice since it is actually a combination of 6 individual nodes each with their own CPU, memory and storage. So a hex is actually a cluster of 6 nodes (hence the name 'hex').

We got a lot of feedback from people saying that there was something wrong with our design. There was a really big hole in the middle. Surely there would be better ways to place these nodes so they would not take up that much space. Well, we actually did that on purpose. All though we are using low-power ARM based computing units which produce a significant less amount of heat then their intel based counterparts, there still is some heat we need to get rid of. The hole in the middle of the hex serves as a chimney, making use of natural air convection to evacuate hot air out of the hex from the top and sucking in cool air from the bottom. Pretty neat, right?

You can find more details about the hex in its own documentation section.

Console
=======================================================================================================================
Contrary to what many people expect when they first look at BigBoards, it is not all about hardware. The console provides an easy way to work with your hex. It allows you to monitor the usage of the hex' resources, but that's not all. It also allows you to perform operations like updating the software running on the hex or even installing tints. Consider it to be the gateway to your hex.

Tint
=======================================================================================================================
One of the goals of BigBoards is to get you up and running as fast as possible. To fulfill this promise we came up with a tint. A tint is something you can put onto your hex, software wise. That might sound quite vague, but let me make it more concrete by classifying tints in 3 different categories:

#. Technology Tints
#. Data Tints
#. Educational Tints

Each of these tint categories provide a different facility to the hex. Technology tints for example bring distributed software stacks to the hex while a data tint will provide that data for you to work on. Educational tints are something special since they provide the tutorials, howto's, documentation and other resources you need to learn about technologies. By combining all of these we can come up with a total solution for building scalable software solutions.
