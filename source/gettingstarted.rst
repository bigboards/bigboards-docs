Making a network connection
===========================
The hex contains a switch which you can use at any time to hook your laptop to the device. There is no DHCP server running so you will have to configure an ip address yourself.

All nodes inside your hex will have addresses going from 172.20.40.1 till 172.20.40.6 with a subnetmask of 255.255.255.240. A good bet would be to give your PC an address between 172.20.40.7 and 172.20.40.12. Once you have done so, you should be able to connect to the management console at http://172.20.40.1:3000/
